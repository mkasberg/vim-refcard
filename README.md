# vim-refcard
A single-page reference card for Vim.

My intent is not to compile an exhaustive list of Vim commands. Rather, I want to make a list of the most useful commands that I sometimes forget.

You are free to redistribute and modify the PDF and TeX source however you'd like.

## Compiling
Run `pdflatex vim-refcard.tex`
